# BaPs üéÆ

#### [Chinese](README.md)

#### This fork is a fork of the original project with various patches in the spirit of open-source
#### This fork is made under the platform license grant to all GitHub users by public repositories, relevant legal information GitHub Terms of Service ¬ßC.5
#### The original project has major problems with the legality of its "terms of service" or license. It contains clauses that are not enforceable in a court of law, but rather only by blackmail, public shaming, or doxxing. Specifically:
  - > ‰∏•Á¶ÅÂú®‰∏≠ÂõΩÂ§ßÈôÜÂú∞Âå∫ÁöÑ‰ªª‰ΩïÂÖ¨ÂÖ±ÊàñÁßÅÊúâÂπ≥Âè∞‰∏ä‰º†„ÄÅÂàÜ‰∫´ÊàñÂÆ£‰º†Êú¨È°πÁõÆÁöÑÊ∫êÁ†Å„ÄÅÁºñËØëÊñá‰ª∂„ÄÅÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ÊïôÁ®ã„ÄÅÊà™Âõæ„ÄÅÊºîÁ§∫ËßÜÈ¢ëÁ≠âÁõ∏ÂÖ≥ÂÜÖÂÆπÔºõ
    > Ëã•ÂèëÁé∞ËøùËßÑ‰º†Êí≠Ë°å‰∏∫Ôºå‰ΩúËÄÖÊúâÊùÉÈááÂèñÂ∞ÅÁ¶Å„ÄÅÂÖ¨ÂºÄÊãâÈªëÁ≠âÊé™ÊñΩ„ÄÇ

  - This above clause stopping the advertising (and distribution) of the source code is largely unenforceable, and the specified actions likely falls under fair use. As laid out in the platform agreement for public repositories (TOS ¬ßC.5), non-exclusive, unrevokable rights to distribute the code using GitHub features are granted to all users. Simply sharing some public GitHub link does not constitute a violation of applicable Fair Use law. Content generated by users, such as tutorials, further fall under the Fair Use category. The author has no legal ground, such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), that allows the author to stop original work produced from other users. Thus, such clauses are null and void in a court of law. However, the author does have one part of the clause active, the part that stops the distribution (by uploading) of binaries and source code on Chinese platforms. As such, this fork will not distribute binaries or anything of the kind otherwise due to legality issues. Users are urged to build from source.

- It is unclear the legality of this clause under commercial use. However, this clause is unenforceable and is null and void in a court of law for users that are using it on a personal, noncommercial scale. The clause is only enforceable by blackmail, threatening a maintainance/support stop and public shaming/doxxing. Doxxing is, of course, against the law, both in the juristiction of China and the United States. Applicable violations of Chinese law include ÈùûÊ≥ïËé∑Âèñ„ÄÅ‰ΩøÁî®„ÄÅ‰º†Êí≠‰∏™‰∫∫‰ø°ÊÅØ (Illegal use of personal information). No contract is valid legal tenure if its terms do not obey law.

- One-sided license changes are not enforceable unless explictly agreed upon. The vague clauses that do not even come in a dedicated license file are not proper notice or legal agreements, and thus are null and void in a court of law.


#### Due to various issues, mostly the original author's issue with people being able to access and run information from the original public project easily. As such, the original author has used various forms of encryption and data gatekeeping to gatekeep builds. (Specifically, there is special data encryption and other processing functions such as mx.DeExcelBytes, which are private and not present in the source code. This was not present at the start of the project)
